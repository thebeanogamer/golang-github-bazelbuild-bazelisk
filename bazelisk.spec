%global common_description %{expand:
Bazelisk is a wrapper for Bazel written in Go.
It automatically picks a good version of Bazel given your current working directory, 
downloads it from the official server (if required) and then transparently passes 
through all command-line arguments to the real Bazel binary.
You can call it just like you would call Bazel.}
